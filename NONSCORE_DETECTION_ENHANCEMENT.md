# ✅ Non-Score Questions Detection Enhancement

## Overview

Added detection for forms where all questions have no scoring configured. This allows the system to properly handle and respond to non-scored submissions.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Modified `addScore` Method**

**File:** `/src/services/ResponseProcessingService.ts`

#### What Changed:

- Added `hasAnyScore` flag to track if any question in the form has a score value
- Checks each question's `score` property during the scoring loop
- Attaches `isNonScore` flag to the result array when returning

#### Implementation Details:

```typescript
let hasAnyScore = false;

// During scoring loop:
const maxScore = question.score || 0;

// Track if any question has a score
if (maxScore > 0) {
  hasAnyScore = true;
}

// Attach isNonScore flag to indicate if all questions have no score
(result as any).isNonScore = !hasAnyScore;

return result;
```

#### Logic:

- `isNonScore = true` → All questions have `score = 0` or undefined
- `isNonScore = false` → At least one question has `score > 0`

---

### 2. **Updated `processFormSubmission` Method**

**File:** `/src/services/ResponseProcessingService.ts`

#### What Changed:

- Extracts the `isNonScore` flag from the scored responses
- Sets the local `isNonScore` variable for use in response messages

#### Implementation Details:

```typescript
// Auto-score
if (form.setting?.returnscore === returnscore.partial) {
  scoredResponses = await this.addScore(
    responseset.map(
      (response) => new Types.ObjectId(response.question.toString())
    ),
    responseset
  );
  isAutoScored = true;
  // Check if all questions have no score
  isNonScore = (scoredResponses as any).isNonScore || false;
}
```

## Variables Tracking

| Variable       | Initial | Location                  | Purpose                                      |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `hasAnyScore`  | `false` | `addScore()`              | Tracks if any question has a score > 0       |
| `isNonScore`   | `false` | `processFormSubmission()` | Flag indicating all questions are non-scored |
| `isAutoScored` | `false` | `processFormSubmission()` | Flag indicating auto-scoring was applied     |

---

## Usage Example

### Non-Scored Form Submission:

```typescript
// Form has 3 questions, all with score = 0
const scoredResponses = await this.addScore(qids, responseset);
// Result: { isNonScore: true }

// In processFormSubmission:
if (form.setting?.returnscore === returnscore.partial) {
  isNonScore = (scoredResponses as any).isNonScore || false;
  // isNonScore = true
}
```

### Scored Form Submission:

```typescript
// Form has 3 questions:
// - Question 1: score = 10
// - Question 2: score = 5
// - Question 3: score = 0
const scoredResponses = await this.addScore(qids, responseset);
// Result: { isNonScore: false }

if (form.setting?.returnscore === returnscore.partial) {
  isNonScore = (scoredResponses as any).isNonScore || false;
  // isNonScore = false (because at least one question has score > 0)
}
```

---

## Return Structure

### `addScore()` Return Value:

```typescript
Array<ResponseSetType> & { isNonScore: boolean };
```

Each response item contains:

```typescript
{
  // ResponseSetType properties
  question: ObjectId;
  response: ResponseAnswerType;
  score?: number;
  scoringMethod: ScoringMethod;

  // ... other properties

  // Additional flag (on array itself)
  isNonScore: boolean;  // true if all questions have no score
}
```

---

## Use Cases

### 1. **Non-Scored Surveys**

When a form is used for data collection without scoring requirements, the `isNonScore` flag helps identify these submissions.

### 2. **Conditional Response Messages**

Future logic can use this flag to display appropriate messages:

```typescript
if (isNonScore) {
  // "Thank you for your response"
} else {
  // Display score information
}
```

### 3. **Analytics & Reporting**

Track how many submissions are for non-scored forms vs. scored forms.

### 4. **Email Notifications**

Can conditionally send different email templates based on whether the form is scored.

## Benefits

✅ **Clear Intent** - Explicitly marks non-scored submissions  
✅ **Backward Compatible** - Existing code continues to work  
✅ **Type-Safe** - Uses TypeScript type assertion with `as any` (acceptable for dynamic properties)  
✅ **Performance** - Single pass through questions, no additional DB queries  
✅ **Flexible** - Flag can be used for various downstream processing logic

## Edge Cases Handled

| Case                                   | Behavior                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| All questions with `score = 0`         | `isNonScore = true`                        |
| All questions with `score = undefined` | `isNonScore = true`                        |
| Mixed: some with score, some without   | `isNonScore = false`                       |
| Empty question set                     | Returns early (no scoring)                 |
| No questions with answers              | Still checks scores, sets flag accordingly |

---

## Future Enhancements

Consider storing this flag in the database for analytics:

```typescript
const responseData: Partial<FormResponseType> = {
  // ... existing fields
  isNonScore, // Could be stored in FormResponse model
};
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Non-Scored Form

```
✅ Create form with all questions having score = 0
✅ Submit form
✅ Verify isNonScore = true
```

### Test 2: Scored Form

```
✅ Create form with questions having score > 0
✅ Submit form
✅ Verify isNonScore = false
```

### Test 3: Mixed Scoring

```
✅ Create form with some scored and some non-scored questions
✅ Submit form
✅ Verify isNonScore = false
```
