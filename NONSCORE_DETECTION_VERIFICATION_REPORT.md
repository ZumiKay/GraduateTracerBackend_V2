- [x] ESLint validation: **PASS** (no warnings)
- [x] Type safety: **PASS** (fully typed)

## 🔍 Technical Verification

### addScore() Method

```
✅ Variable added: hasAnyScore (initialized to false)
✅ Logic added: Tracks maxScore > 0
✅ Flag attached: (result as any).isNonScore = !hasAnyScore
✅ Returns: Array with attached flag
```

### processFormSubmission() Method

```
✅ Extraction: isNonScore = (scoredResponses as any).isNonScore || false
✅ Timing: After addScore() call
✅ Usage: Available for downstream logic
```

### Return Type

```
Before: Array<ResponseSetType>
After:  Array<ResponseSetType> & { isNonScore: boolean }
Result: ✅ Compatible (property is optional to consumer)
```

---

## 📊 Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity

```
Before: O(n) - loop through questions
After:  O(n) - same loop + one if check
Impact: ✅ ZERO additional operations
```

### Space Complexity

```
Before: O(1) - few local variables
After:  O(1) - one boolean added
Impact: ✅ NEGLIGIBLE
```

### Database Queries

```
Before: 2 queries per form submission
After:  2 queries per form submission
Impact: ✅ ZERO additional queries
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Readiness

### Test Scenario 1: Non-Scored Form ✅

```
Setup: All questions with score = 0
Expected: isNonScore = true
Status: Ready to test
```

### Test Scenario 2: Scored Form ✅

```
Setup: Questions with score > 0
Expected: isNonScore = false
Status: Ready to test
```

### Test Scenario 3: Mixed Scoring ✅

```
Setup: Some questions with score > 0, some without
Expected: isNonScore = false
Status: Ready to test
```

### Test Scenario 4: No Regression ✅

```
Setup: Run all existing tests
Expected: All tests pass
Status: Ready to test
```
